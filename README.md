High-Interaction Frontend Website (GSAP + Motion Design)

A high-fidelity frontend project inspired by modern digital product design agencies, focused on motion, interaction, and user experience rather than static UI.

This project was built as a hands-on exploration of frontend motion design and UI engineering, translating design intent into interactive behavior.

🧠 Project Focus

The goal of this project was to translate design intent into motion using JavaScript and GSAP, with careful attention to timing, easing, and user-driven interactions.

Key areas of focus:

Page-load and navigation animations

Hover and mouse-driven micro-interactions

Video reveal and playback interactions

Clean layout structure for complex sections

Smooth, responsive user experience

✨ Features

Animated navigation with dropdown motion

GSAP timeline-based page load animations

Mouse-follow image interactions

Interactive video reveal on user action

Hover-based video previews in content sections

Smooth transitions and consistent easing

🛠 Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic structure

CSS3 – layout, responsiveness, transitions

JavaScript (Vanilla) – interaction logic

GSAP – animations, timelines, easing


🚀 What I Learned

How animation timing affects UX, not just visuals

Structuring GSAP timelines for maintainable motion logic

Handling mouse events for real-time interactions

Building interactive UI without heavy frameworks

Balancing visual impact with performance considerations

🔧 Status

This project is under active iteration, focusing on:
Performance improvements

Animation polish

Cleaner interaction handling

📌 Notes

This is a learning-focused frontend project, built from scratch to better understand modern UI engineering and motion design patterns.
